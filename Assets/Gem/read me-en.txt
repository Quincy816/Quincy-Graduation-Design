How to use:

1、Create a material named "gem". Select the "gem" material in assets, and choose the Unlit/gem in the "Shader" option.

2、Assign the gem_common.cube(Gem/Textures/gem_common) to the RefractCube parameter.

3、Assign the hdr_EvnLighting_wb.cube(Gem/Textures) to the Evn lighting paramter.

4、Assign the hdr_EvnCubemap.cube or hdr_EvnLighting_wb.cueb(Gem/Textures) to the Env Texture paramter.(you can use your environment cubemap assign to it.)

5、Assign the dispersion_0.cube(Gem/Textures) to the Dispersion Tex paramter.

6、Assign "gem" material to your gem model.

Other paramters:
1、Gem Color: the color of the gem.(I advise you to build a refact cubemap with color in maya or 3dmax. It would have a good effect than changing the Gem Color.)

2、_Emission: the emission color of the gem.(notice:gem can not give out light in truth.)

3、Specular Power&Dispersion Power
x:specular exponent
y:the brightness of supecular
z:the power of dispersion(0.25 is good)

4、Reflect Strength: 0.1~0.2 is good.

At last:forgive my poor english.

Gem2.0 new feature:
1、Remove 'Env Texture'、'Reflect Strength'and 'EnvLighting' options.(There is no need now)
2、Support Reflection Probe.
3、Using new method to calculate dispersion.It is more realistic than before.
4、Support gamma space. But there is also a little different between linear space and gamma space because of the 'blend' calculation.
